"""
An RSS feed (Really Simple Syndication) is a type of web feed that allows users and applications to receive updates
to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

Publishers (like blogs, news sites, or podcasts) create an RSS feed — an XML file containing summaries or full content of their latest updates.

Users subscribe to that feed using an RSS reader (such as Feedly, Inoreader, or an email client).

The reader periodically checks the feed and shows new content, so users can stay updated without visiting each site individually.

Example Use Case:
You follow 10 blogs. Instead of visiting each site daily, you subscribe to their RSS feeds in one app. That app aggregates all new posts in one place.

Would you like to see an example of what an RSS feed file looks like?
